  <h2 class='c004'>Reports on Atrocities in the Districts of Yalova and Guemlek and in the Ismid Peninsula.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>(Translation.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Report of the Inter-Allied Commission instructed to conduct Enquiries regarding
the Excesses committed against the Turkish Population in the Regions of Yalova
and Guemlek.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The members of the Commission of Enquiry left Constantinople on the
12th May and arrived at Guemlek in the evening. They immediately communicated
with General Leonardopoulos, commanding the 10th Greek Division and quartered
at Guemlek.</p>

<p class='c007'>This general officer furnished them with all material means required by the
mission.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The region to be visited by the commission includes the larger portion of the
kazas of Yalova and of Guemlek—a hilly peninsula containing about forty villages,
thirty-five of which are exclusively Turkish. In the adjoining region of Bazarkeui,
on the western and northern shores of the lake of Nicea, there are ten Armenian
villages, some of which (with the exception of the village of Chengeller, which was
burned by the Kemalists in April last) were destroyed by the Turks during the war
and after the armistice.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Guemlek there are at present 2,000 refugees from these Armenian villages,
as well as 1,500 Moslem refugees from adjoining villages which have been destroyed,
as also some 3,500 Greek refugees from the Greek localities of Elmalik, Fulajik,
Ortakeui and Nicea, which were burned or destroyed by Kemalists during 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'>Guemlek, the principal town in the district, had some 6,000 Greek and 1,000
Moslem inhabitants before these events took place.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. During the last nine months the region has been occupied by weak detachments
of the Greek army, about eight companies in all. The front line, Yalova-Bazarkeui,
is held by five companies and one machine-gun company. Guemlek is
occupied by about two companies. A small detachment of twenty-six men is at
Armudli.</p>

<p class='c007'>The headquarters of the 10th Greek Division is at Guemlek. The troops
belonging to this division provide cover for the Greek army further towards the east
in the direction of Yeni Shehr.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Turkish civilian administration is non-existent throughout this region. It
has not been replaced by any other organisation.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The commission carried out its task in the region east of Guemlek and on
the northern shore of the Gulf of Mudania from the 13th to the 20th May. On the
20th May it proceeded to the region of Yalova and returned to Constantinople on
the 22nd May, having completed its mission.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this period it carried out the following tasks:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>During two days it heard, either at the mayor’s house or at the Turkish headquarters at 
    Guemlek, all Greek, Armenian and Moslem inhabitants who had any statements to make with 
    regard to the events which recently took place in this region.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>All these statements, even those concerning occurrences which took place a long time ago, 
    or in distant localities, were received.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>It visited villages which had been burned within the line of outposts, such as Chengeller 
    (Armenian), and Bazarkeui (Turkish), as also the Turkish villages of Chitelji and Gedelek 
    in the rear of this line, which had also been burned.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>On the 15th May the commission, having watched from its ship the burning of villages on 
    the northern shore of the Gulf of Mudania, proceeded on the 15th, 16th and 17th May to 
    the Turkish localities known as Narli, Karaja Ali, Kumlar, Kapakli, and Fistikli, and to 
    that of Armudli, inhabited by Greeks and Moslems.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>It established the fact of the recent passage of armed Greek and Armenian bands, and 
    noted that Kapakli, Narli and Karaja Ali were <span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>still burning. In these villages, 
    as also in the neighbourhood of that of Kumlar, the commission found twenty-eight bodies 
    of old men and women who had been recently shot or knocked on the head. An infant was 
    also found alive at Kapakli.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>The commission collected all the statements concerning recent events, and more 
    particularly that of the Greek officer commanding a reconnoitring detachment which had 
    operated between Guemlek and Armudli on the 13th, 14th and 15th May, as well as that of 
    the Greek officer in command of the fixed post of Armudli.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>The commission assured the embarkation for Constantinople of the inhabitants of Kumlar 
    and the Moslem refugees of Guemlek (some 2,300).
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>e.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>In the region of Yalova the commission visited Yalova, Chinarjik, Inguereh and Koja 
    Dereh. It received the statements of Greek and Turkish inhabitants of Yalova and those of 
    the Greek inhabitants of Chinarjik.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>The commission did not consider it advisable to visit the Turkish villages of
Ak Keui and Samanli, where there were still some 300 Moslems. As it was not sure
of being able to help them immediately, the commission feared that it might be
placed in as difficult a position as that in which it found itself a few days before at
Kutchuk-Kumlar, when the terror-stricken population spontaneously placed itself
under its protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The detailed narrative of the work done each day, as well as of the statements
collected, are attached to the present report.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. In consequence of the statements received, of the observations made and facts
established on the spot, and of their impressions as a whole, the members of the
commission believe that they can set down the following statement:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>All the Moslem villages of the regions visited—with the exception of Omer Bey, Yalova, Ak 
    Keui and Samanli—are abandoned, and were mostly looted and burned by Christian bands less 
    than two months ago.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>The population of these villages is at present scattered. Some of the inhabitants assured 
    their own safety by leaving the district before the destruction of their village. Others 
    were either able to flee to the mountains when the bands attacked, or were, according to 
    statements made, carried off by the assailants. Some have been massacred.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>The fate of the majority of the population which took refuge in the mountains is unknown. 
    No figures can be given with any accuracy.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>It has not been possible actually to verify any of the atrocities properly so-called (men 
    shut up and burned, children thrown on the fire, women violated and disembowelled), 
    mentioned in the reports of the Turkish authorities. It has, however, been definitely 
    established that women and defenceless old men were shot or knocked on the head in the 
    villages of Kapakli and Karaja Ali, sometimes even in their own houses.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>The Christian population does not appear to have been disarmed, and it also appears that 
    the Moslem population was able to keep hidden weapons.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>e.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>In the localities occupied by Greek troops, the Moslem population complains of 
    molestation and threats. These facts should not be regarded as anything else but the 
    application (occasionally somewhat harsh) of police measures connected with the state of 
    occupation.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>f.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>The Greek authorities who are providing for the maintenance of Armenian and Greek 
    refugees at Guemlek, give no food and no medical assistance to Moslem refugees (about 
    1,500 after the evacuation of Bazarkeui).
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>g.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Acts of violence and barbarism, as well as massacres on a large scale, were undoubtedly 
    committed in 1920 by Kemalist bands, or by soldiers of the regular army, against the 
    Christian population of the region not occupied by the Greek army, east of Yalova, north 
    of the lake of Nicea, and in the region of Nicea.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>Statements dealing more particularly with the atrocities committed in the Greek villages 
    of Elmalik, Fulajik and Nicea, are attached to the present report, as well as statements 
    relating to Kemalist excesses in certain localities of the more distant region of Yeni 
    Shehr.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>It has been impossible to check the truth of all these statements on the spot. They may 
    be exaggerated, in the same way as the statements made by the Turks, but appear to 
    contain an element of truth.
<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span></div>
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>h.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>In the region visited, the Armenian village of Chengeller, which is situated in advance 
    of the Greek line, was attacked and burned in April last by a Kemalist band. The 
    population fled to Bazarkeui, which was then occupied by a Greek detachment, and from 
    there was sent to Guemlek. Some persons were killed, but there were no massacres. As a 
    reprisal, the village of Bazarkeui was burned after it had been evacuated by the Moslem 
    population, which was ordered by the Greeks to proceed to Guemlek.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>i.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Both soldiers and Christian inhabitants have stated that bands of Turkish brigands were 
    scouring the country, and that Turkish peasants were committing outrages upon isolated 
    Christians. A detachment of Greek soldiers, when reconnoitring at Narli on the 13th May, 
    was said to have been fired on by a band of Turkish brigands, one soldier being killed. 
    In the neighbourhood of Armudli, seven Greeks are also said to have been killed a few 
    days ago. It was impossible to verify the truth of these statements. On the 12th May, on 
    the other hand, two Greek youths of Guemlek, who were on their way to Kumlar, were found 
    dead on the beach. This murder, which was not reported by the Greek authorities, was 
    brought to the knowledge of the commission indirectly.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>j.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Burning and looting of Turkish villages in this region occurred less than two months ago. 
    This destruction seems systematic, being carried out by Greek and Armenian bands. It 
    appears to be proved that detachments of the Greek regular army take part therein.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>k.</i>)</dt>
    <dd>The Greek Command has not answered any enquiries made by the commission with regard to 
    its personal impression of the present state of affairs in the country. That command 
    apparently affects to attach but little importance to the destruction being carried out, 
    which it views as reprisals for isolated attacks or for violence previously committed by 
    the Turks.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>It was only after the events of the 15th May, and late in the evening, that
measures were taken to protect the Moslem population of Kumlar.</p>

<p class='c007'>One reconnoitring detachment was, it is true, sent to the region between
Guemlek and Armudli between the 12th and 15th May, but this detachment, whose
task was only “to disarm and to clear,” did not prevent the looting or burnings
which took place at the very time of its presence in the localities of Karaja Ali,
Narli, and Kutchuk Kumlar.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. The commission endeavoured to arrive at the causes which, in less than two
months, brought about the destruction or evacuation of nearly all the Moslem villages
of that part of the kazas of Yalova and Guemlek which is occupied by the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>If events which took place at the time of the movements of the Greek army
towards the end of March can explain why the villages near to the Greek line (Dijan
Keui—Reshadie—Soyuljak—Bazar-Keui (Turkish)—Chengeller (Armenian)) were
destroyed or abandoned by reason of attack or as reprisals, the case is not parallel
on the northern shore of the Gulf of Mudania. These latter villages were burned
on the 15th May, when military operations were but few, and without the Greek
Commander having reported the particular acts of provocation, although the commission
had been at Guemlek since the 12th May.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sufficient cause is doubtless presented by the age-long hatred existing between
the various races, increased, in so far as the Greek soldiers and the Greek population
of Guemlek are concerned, by the presence of 2,000 Armenian refugees who suffered
greatly at the hands of the Turks during the war, and by that of 3,600 Greek
refugees, many of whom witnessed the atrocities committed by the Kemalists at
Fulajik, Elmalik and Nicea. But although this hatred can explain the severity of
the treatment suffered by Moslem villages, it does not appear to have been the determining
factor of their destruction on so general and rapid a scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>A distinct and regular method appears to have been followed in the destruction
of villages, group by group, for the last two months, which destruction has even
reached the neighbourhood of the Greek headquarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The members of the commission consider that, in the part of the kazas of Yalova
and Guemlek occupied by the Greek army, there is a systematic plan of destruction
of Turkish villages and extinction of the Moslem population. This plan is being
carried out by Greek and Armenian bands, which appear to operate under Greek
instructions and sometimes even with the assistance of detachments of regular troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>This destruction of villages and the disappearance of the Moslem population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>consequent thereon doubtless has as its object to guard the flanks and rear of the
Greek army against any possible attack by the population in the event of an early
offensive, and perhaps even to create in this region a political situation favourable
to the Greek Government.</p>

<p class='c007'>In any event, the commission is of opinion that the atrocities reported against
Christians on the one hand, and Moslems on the other, are unworthy of a civilised
Government, and that in the region occupied by the Greek army, the Greek authorities,
who are alone in authority there, are responsible, and, in the region under the
Kemalist régime, the Turkish authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. In view of the conclusions arrived at in the course of its enquiry, the commission
considers that it is not within its terms of reference to suggest the measures
which would remedy the state of affairs in the region of Guemlek. The dispersion
of nearly the whole of the Moslem population of the kazas of Yalova and Guemlek
is already a <i>fait accompli</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order, however, to avoid the recurrence of similar happenings in the future
in other regions occupied by the Greek army, the commission proposes that an inter-Allied
gendarmerie be introduced into these regions, or, at any rate, that Allied
officers should be attached to the various Greek commands, for the purposes of
surveillance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, the commission expresses the hope that the 600 Moslems who are still at
Yalova, Ak-Keui and Samanli, should be authorised to take refuge in Constantinople
or its environs and that steps should be taken to this effect.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Diary of the Inter-Allied Commission sent to Enquire into Incidents in the Regions of Guemlek and Yalova.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The commission left Constantinople at noon on the 12th May, and arrived at
Guemlek at 4·30. The Greek General Leonardopoulos, commanding the 10th
Division, who was found to be at Guemlek, at once came on board and appeared
rather vexed at our arrival, but was quite courteous and even offered to place two
motor cars at the disposal of the commission, in order that it might visit Bazar Keui
on the morrow. The commission landed at 6 o’clock and found the mayor on the
beach, who conducted the commission to the Greek part of the town. Hundreds of
refugees from Greek and Armenian villages destroyed by the Kemalists were met,
more particularly those from Kiz Derbent, Elmalik, Vizir Han, Hudieh, Fulajik,
Levkeh and Kuplu. The Greek refugees in Guemlek had very bad quarters, but were
fed by the Greek army.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 9 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the 13th May, the commission drove out to the Turkish villages
behind the Greek lines, Bazar Keui being reached without any incident. A crowd
of Greek refugees, mostly composed of women, gave a friendly demonstration when
the commission left Guemlek. Bazar Keui was found to be completely destroyed,
with the exception of a few houses occupied by Greek troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission was received by the Greek commandant (commander of the
Bazar Keui detachment), who stated that he had not been at Bazar Keui at the
beginning of April, when the village was occupied by the 5th Infantry Regiment.
The present commandant only took over at Bazar Keui on the 15th April. When the
Greek army reached Bilejik a regiment was left behind to ensure communications.
When the retreat commenced, however, the Turkish population became very excited,
and looted and burnt the Greek and Armenian villages of Kiz Derbent and
Chengeller. Many of the inhabitants of these destroyed villages came to Bazar Keui.
At the same time some Turkish peasants attacked the Greek lines of communications,
and in consequence of this the commandant received the order to evacuate the Turkish
population of various villages within his sector. This work began on the
16th April, but when the Turkish houses were left empty, the Greek and Armenian
refugees set fire to them in order to avenge themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this interview, the commission visited the destroyed village of
Chengeller. It had been razed to the ground, but here and there people were still
living in the ruins. They stated that the village had been sacked by the Turks, and
that many of the inhabitants had been killed in their houses.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The commission returned to Bazar Keui. This town had been systematically
destroyed by fire. There were no inhabitants and no proofs of explosion, and no
bodies were found.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission then visited the village of Cheltikji, which was burning when it
arrived. Four Greek soldiers were surprised whilst taking away the flooring of
houses in the village, and it is probable that they had fired those houses which were
still standing. The inhabitants left their village when they saw what was
happening at Bazar Keui; it was fired next day. The commission was unable to find
any trace of bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission visited Gedelek, a village which had been entirely destroyed,
but was unable to find any trace of the twenty-seven people reported to have been
massacred. When the confines of Gedelek were reached, a crowd of refugees and of
soldiers (who had begun by making a friendly demonstration) suddenly noticed
Mulazim Sureyah Effendi, guide to the commission, and attacked him. He was
dragged from the motor, and was only brought back on board the “Bryony” after
great difficulty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission returned on board at 6 o’clock, and the Head of the Greek Staff
came on board the “Bryony” to offer his apologies for the incident, which had taken
place in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 9 o’clock on the 14th May, the commission sat at the mayor’s house in order
to hear any complaints which Greeks and Armenians might have to make. The
mayor very kindly asked the commission to lunch, but his invitation was declined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first person to lay a complaint gave to the commission a general summary
of the atrocities perpetrated against the Armenians since the outbreak of war. In
this region eighteen villages had been destroyed and the population reduced from
70,000 to 2,500. When asked how the question of this mixture of races could be
settled, he replied that Christianity could not exist under a Turkish Government,
even if an inter-Allied gendarmerie were created.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last Armenian massacre commenced a year ago, <i>i.e.</i>, at the beginning of the
Kemalist movement, when Anatolia was evacuated by the Allied troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>Complaints from Chengeller, Yeni-Keui, Keramet and Murdigheuz were heard,
all referring to the massacres and burnings of August 1915, and the middle of 1920.
More particularly, some women of Fulajik (a Greek village) were heard. They told
us of terrible atrocities, and stated that the Turkish officer who was guide to the
commission was one of the officers responsible for these massacres.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission continued its enquiry at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, in the house
of the mayor. Men and women were heard, some from Vizir-Han, Kiz Derbent,
Elmalik, Soyuljak, Cherkesskeui, Deli-Bazar, and Orta-Keui. All had more or less
the same tale to tell—Kemalists would arrive in their village from time to time,
first asking for money and food, then taking cattle and horses, and finally, when the
village had nothing more to give, a massacre would take place and the houses would
be fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>On leaving the mayor’s house, the commission called on the Greek general and
took tea with him. It returned to the “Bryony” at 6·30, the “Bryony” remaining
at anchor at Guemlek for the night.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>May 15.</i>—It was the intention of the commission to go to Kumlar to make an
enquiry as to what had occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 8 o’clock smoke was seen to rise above the village of Narli. The commission
went on board the motor boat, but, unfortunately, it had a breakdown, and the
members had to return to their ship. At 10 o’clock, a cloud of smoke was observed
above Karaja Ali. As the motor boat could not take us there, orders were given
to remain on board, and the “Bryony” made for the flaming villages. Narli was
reached at 2 o’clock. That village was still a mass of glowing ruins, and it was
decided to land at Karaja Ali, which was burning fiercely, and on the beach corpses
were seen. Twelve old people, one of whom was an aged woman, were found on the
shore. Two men were still alive and were taken on board the “Bryony” by her
doctor. It was impossible to get into the village owing to the intense heat. The
mosque and the school, which were on a slight elevation, were the only two buildings
which had not been fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 4·30 the commission landed at Kutchuk Kumlar, a village about 2½ kilom.
from the point of debarkation. The houses on the beach were entirely destroyed,
and one was in flames. Horses had been sent by the Greek general, who the day
before had been informed of our intention to visit the village.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission made for Kutchuk Kumlar. Several hundreds of terror-stricken
inhabitants, mostly women, were waiting for the commission to land.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>It was difficult to obtain exact information, so great was the panic among the
population, but it was gathered that a detachment of Greek soldiers and brigands
had gone through the village a few days before and had returned that very morning,
passing the Kumlar landing-place. The commission returned on board, followed by
the entire population, which placed itself under the protection of the Allies and
refused to leave the beach, imploring us to take them to quiet and safety. That end
of the jetty which was nearest to the “Bryony” was most densely covered with
people. A letter was then written to General Leonardopoulos, asking him to take
immediate steps for the protection of the village of Kumlar.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was only possible to hand him this letter at 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> next day. The “Bryony”
remained at anchor beyond the landing-place, throwing her searchlights over the
beach and the adjoining hills all night long, in order to reassure the refugees.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>May 16.</i>—At 9 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> the commission landed, in order to collect all possible
information from the refugees on the beach. One wounded and two dead men were
brought along by the natives.</p>

<p class='c007'>The refugees stated that the day before a group of them, about twenty strong,
tried to get to Guemlek in order to procure bread. They left the village, and, on
arriving at the landing-place, met a detachment of Greek soldiers and brigands,
commanded by a Greek officer. The women were sent back to the village, and the
men were forced to follow the bandits. On the way some of the men were given the
order to return, and others were killed, the muktar being among the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 10 o’clock the commission reached the village, which was completely
destroyed. A corporal and ten men sent by General Leonardopoulos (before the
arrival of the letter sent that morning, which he could not have received) were on
guard. The corporal was questioned by the commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>On returning to the landing-place, a Greek staff officer, sent by the general
commanding the Greek division, was waiting for the commission. At the request
of the latter he assured the refugees that they would be properly protected, a promise
which had no effect on the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission then made for Kapakli. The village was entirely destroyed.
Two or three terrified inhabitants were found among the ruins. They told the
commission that the natives were hidden in the mountains, fearing that they would
be killed on appearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission went through the village and found eight corpses, four of which
were those of women. Three of the dead men had been killed a fortnight before,
in a preceding engagement. The five others had been killed during the morning of
the preceding day. The commission found an infant which had been abandoned and
which was taken on board.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three survivors begged the Commission to take them to a safe spot. They
were told to inform the refugees who were hiding in the mountains, and that if all
assembled on the beach they would be taken to Kutchuk Kumlar next day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission made for Narli, which village was found to be entirely
destroyed. There were no dead to be seen and there was only one remaining inhabitant—an
old Turk—who said that he was quite happy, and who made the commission
feel that its visit was an intrusion!</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Bryony” remained anchored outside Kutchuk Kumlar all night, we
having returned to that spot.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>May 17.</i>—At 8·30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> two Greek officers, who were in command of the
detachment, sent to Guemlek on the 11th to search and disarm villagers between
Guemlek and Armudli, were sent on board by one of the Greek staff officers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission interrogated them. The date when they passed through the
burned villages corresponded exactly with the time when those villages were found
to be in flames. One officer acknowledged that he had had four Turks shot, but
apart from this denied any knowledge of murder or looting.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 9·30 we left Kutchuk Kumlar for Fistikli. We towed two caiques, to be
left at Kapakli, to convey the refugees who were able to leave the mountains in view
of the promise made by the commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>About 200 refugees were found to have assembled on the beach. The “Bryony”
left the caiques, with the necessary escort, and proceeded to Fistikli. That village
appeared to be perfectly quiet. Turkish and Greek merchants were selling their
olives on the landing-place.</p>

<p class='c007'>An officer was sent ashore to make enquiries. The Turks, terrified at what was
passing in other villages, were selling their goods before leaving for Armudli.
(The price offered by the Greeks was certainly below the usual standard.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Armudli was reached at mid-day. The village appeared quiet. An officer was
sent ashore to ask the officer commanding the Greek detachment to come on board
and report if it was necessary for the commission to visit the village.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was decided that the commission should interrogate the chief Greek and
Turkish inhabitants at the landing-place at 2 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek officer stated that all was quiet and that he had orders to guard the
village only.</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke of several cases of brigandage in the adjoining farms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The representatives of the Greek and Turkish committees appeared to be living
in absolute agreement, but, on being questioned separately, nevertheless complained
of each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission went back on board the “Bryony” and made for Kapakli, in
order to tow the two caiques, which were brought back full of refugees to Kutchuk-Kumlar.</p>

<p class='c007'>On arriving at Kumlar, the representative of the Red Cross stated that he had
spoken with the brigand chief, who had arrived at the landing-place during the
absence of the “Bryony” in order to terrorise the refugees and boast of his doings.
A message was sent to General Leonardopoulos, advising him of the arrival of the
brigand chief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Bryony” remained anchored outside Kutchuk Kumlar during the night.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>May 18.</i>—At 8 o’clock the “Bryony” returned to Guemlek. At 9 o’clock the
commission went ashore and visited the Turkish quarter and a mosque full of Moslem
refugees.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission conducted its enquiry at the seat of the Turkish Administration.
All the people were filled with terror, received no food beyond what they could
procure themselves and asked to be taken away and sent to some quiet place.</p>

<p class='c007'>On returning on board, the commission received a wireless message at 1 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>,
stating that the “Ineboli” had just left Constantinople to take on board refugees
from Kutchuk Kumlar.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission returned to Guemlek, visited the mayor, and informed him of
its intention to take away the Turkish refugees.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 6·30 we returned to Kutchuk Kumlar. At 9 o’clock the boat arrived and
took the refugees on board, the baby which we had on board being handed over to the
care of a Turkish woman. Embarkation was completed at 2 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and the “Ineboli”
left for Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>May 19.</i>—The “Bryony” remained anchored beyond Kutchuk Kumlar. Those
refugees for whom there had been no room on board the “Ineboli,” and who had
been left behind, gained confidence, and several returned to the village to obtain
provisions.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 1 o’clock the brigand chief, Haji Yorghi (who had been met by the representative
of the Red Cross), was brought on board by a staff officer on the order of
the general commanding the Greek troops. He said that he had been drunk
when he boasted the day before, and that in reality he was guide to the Greek detachment
sent to disarm the villagers.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the evening the “Ineboli” and three other boats returned to Kumlar.
The remaining refugees were sent off.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>May 20.</i>—At 6·30 the “Bryony” and the boats sent by the Red Crescent left
Kumlar for Guemlek.</p>

<p class='c007'>The refugees were notified that they were to assemble on the beach in order to
embark. At mid-day the commission went ashore to see what progress was being
made. The Greek officers required that able-bodied men should be left behind,
guaranteeing that they would be properly treated. This proposal was accepted by
the commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission again went ashore at 3·30 and saw the last refugees embark.
The boats then weighed anchor.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 4 o’clock the “Bryony” left Guemlek for Tuzla, where she was to wait
instructions by wireless concerning the voyage to Yalova.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>May 21.</i>—The “Bryony” anchored at Yalova at 8 o’clock. An officer was sent
ashore to inform the commander of the Greek detachment that the Inter-Allied
Commission had arrived.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 9 o’clock the Greek officer commanding the detachment came aboard and was
questioned by the commission. He stated that when he arrived at Yalova, about a
month before, he had found that all the neighbouring villages had been burned. As
far as he knew, there were brigands in the neighbourhood, but his orders were only
to hold Yalova, and his patrols always kept within a radius of 2½ kilom. of it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>The commission went ashore at 10 o’clock and was met by a crowd of Greek
refugees, mostly women.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission sat at the Greek headquarters, and heard complaints made by
Greek refugees, more particularly those from Fulajik.</p>

<p class='c007'>It asked the Greek officer to withdraw, and the kaïmakam was heard. He
stated that before the war the population of the Yalova district was one-half
Christian and one-half Turkish. Yalova itself was a Turkish town.</p>

<p class='c007'>At present there were only 300 Turks in Yalova and a few hundreds in the
distant villages of Samanli and Ak-Keui.</p>

<p class='c007'>The kaïmakam asked the commission to evacuate the Turkish population to a
place of safety. On leaving the Greek headquarters, the commission found the
Greek refugees raving with anger. The reason for this was that Hafiz Ahmet (one
of the guides of the commission and also one of the chief men of a neighbouring
village, who had gone ashore that morning with the commission) had been accused
by some Greek women of having been implicated in various massacres which had
taken place in the neighbourhood. It was with the very greatest difficulty, and only
by turning the attention of the crowd on another point, that he was enabled to enter
a boat and return on board. He was pursued by a howling crowd, which even
entered the water while the boat was pushing off with all speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 2·30 the “Bryony” anchored at Chinejik and the commission at once went
ashore. The Turkish quarter was quite empty, but not destroyed. The mosque
had been looted, but not burned, and no traces were found of the horrible massacres
reported as having taken place at this spot.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek priest showed the commission freshly-turned Turkish graves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Bryony” then left for Enguri. When the commission went ashore, it
was received by the officer commanding the Greek detachment. As far as he knew,
only brigandage had taken place in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission then made for the twin villages of Kojadereh, which were
entirely destroyed. There were no inhabitants and no bodies were found; no
information was obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commission returned to the “Bryony,” which remained at anchor off shore
all night.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>May 22.</i>—Returned at 8·30 and arrived at Top-Haneh, Constantinople.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c012'><i>Constantinople, June 1, 1921.</i></div>

<p class='c007'>We have the honour to submit the following report in accordance with your
instructions and with the terms of reference for the above-named Commission of
Enquiry:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Credible evidence has been produced as to crimes committed during the last
twelve months by both Greeks and Turks. There is no doubt that there have been
a large number of atrocities in the Ismid peninsula, and it appears that those on the
part of the Turks have been more considerable and ferocious than those on the part
of the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>We attach a résumé of our investigations upon which our opinions are based;
and will prepare a schedule giving full details.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The present state of affairs is largely due to racial feeling and age-long
vendetta, now fanned to an intense pitch by exaggerated stories which promote fear
and excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Greek regular troops have been implicated in recent excesses, and both
officers and soldiers; more especially lately when the troops have been on the march.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the zone which is effectively occupied by the Greek army there is order, but
it appears to be maintained at the cost of oppressing the Turkish population. This
evil is accentuated by the Turkish Civil Administration, which, particularly in the
neighbourhood of Ismid, is venal and corrupt, and allows itself to be used by the
Greeks, to carry out their policy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek military authority admits that nothing is done to maintain order in
districts not actually occupied by Greek troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>4 (<i>a</i>). The commission recommend that full advantage should be taken of the
existing Turkish organisation for the maintenance of order and that this should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>expanded and made more powerful. European officers to be made available to give
assistance to the Central Government, and this especially in the way of control of
officials charged with the administration of justice, such European officers also being
made responsible for reporting to their Government any infringement of international
law by either belligerent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Also that pressure be brought to bear upon the Greek military authorities to
maintain civil order and justice by means of this organisation in such portions of
Asia Minor as they occupy or can control.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>b</i> 1.) Where either side is in the ascendancy the survivors of the other in many
cases become fugitive; the men often become brigands. The estimate given by the
Greek Colonel Commandant of the 11th Division at Ismid was of some 12,000 to
15,000 Christian refugees in Ismid itself, mostly women and children.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek army have instituted conscription of those Ottoman subjects who are
Christian refugees, who have to leave their families in great distress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moslems who are now in the power of the Greeks are in a state of great fear and
wish to escape or to be given protection. Such Greeks who still remain in the north
of the Ismid peninsula fear an advance by Nationalist troops and may become
fugitives at any time.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>b</i> 2.) The commission recommend that the Christian refugees should be
removed now to a region which is, and will remain, under Greek Government, or
which will be under the protection of the Allies, and that husbands and fathers who
have been taken by conscription from those dependent on them should be restored to
their families. Also that the Armenians should be removed to an area under the
protection of the Allies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The members of the commission are under the impression that those Moslems
who have become brigands will return to their homes and to peaceful pursuits when
assured of settled conditions under Moslem Administration, and that Greek brigands,
if offered an amnesty, will take the opportunity of trusting the Allies in a scheme for
colonisation in a Greek zone. These men appear usually to have become brigands
only when driven from their homes or after desertion from Turkish military service.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Excesses of which the Greeks are Accused.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The principal excesses of which the Greeks are accused took place after July
1920, when the Greek military forces occupied the territory.</p>

<p class='c007'>These excesses are attributed either to the regular troops or to bands.</p>

<p class='c007'>(A.) When they arrived in the territory (in July and August), the regular
troops attacked various Moslem villages, principally those in the region east of
Beicos. Inhabitants were killed, cattle carried off, and houses and even whole
villages burnt. To this should be added individual offences on the part of soldiers
belonging to Greek detachments, such as extortion of money, theft, violence and
murder. In the occupied regions the Greek military authorities first made numerous
arrests and caused people to be summarily executed (more particularly at Beicos-Chibukli).</p>

<p class='c007'>A good many searches made for hidden weapons gave rise to individual offences,
violence and theft. These individual offences, caused by insufficient discipline, were
not usually stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'>The attacks against villages became more frequent in March and April, when
the Greek troops were abandoning the eastern part of the peninsula, and began in
the region of Ada-Bazar. Turkish villages between Kudra and Ada-Bazar were
chiefly affected, a large number of the inhabitants being maltreated and killed,
women violated, cattle carried off and houses fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>(B.) Greek bands, formed of men who had generally suffered under Turkish
oppression, and who were just as much actuated by a thirst for vengeance as a desire
for loot, carried out depredations during the Greek occupation with an amount of
freedom which leads one to conclude that the Greek military authorities did not
take the necessary steps to prevent these misdeeds.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>In the region of Shileh, it may be even taken as very probable, if not certain,
that the Greek military authorities regarded their formation and activities with
favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the region now occupied by them the Greek forces armed, and used as
auxiliaries, refugees, from Greek villages which had been looted or burnt by the
Turks. By their attacks on Turkish villages situated outside the effective zone of
occupation of the Greek troops, and by the atrocities committed by them, these bands
have revived former hatred and have brought about the ferocious reprisals of which
Greek villages—and specially those of the region south of Ismid—have been the
victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greeks have also employed as auxiliaries a large number of Circassians
(Moslems from the Caucasus), more than 30,000 of whom had taken refuge in the
region east of Ismid. These have become the enemies of the Nationalists.</p>

<p class='c007'>These Circassians furnish excellent semi-regular combatants, but also form
bands whose poorly-controlled activity admits of excesses and thus helps to
perpetuate the régime of continual reprisals which is gradually ravaging and
depopulating the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>To sum up, the Greeks ensure order in the regions effectively occupied by their
troops, but at the price of oppression suffered by the Moslem population.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the regions not effectively occupied by the Greeks the latter favour the
activities of bands of their own countrymen, and are thus partly responsible for the
system of guerilla warfare and atrocities there existing.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Excesses Committed by the Turks.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Attacks on Christians, which had become less numerous since the armistice,
increased in numbers and ferocity—more particularly with regard to the Greeks—in
March 1920, and even more so in June and July 1920 (when preparations were
being made for Greek offensives).</p>

<p class='c007'>Turkish bands of a more or less Kemalist persuasion are scouring the entire
sanjak of Ismid as far as the environs of Scutari (Pashakeui, 20 kilom. east of
Scutari).</p>

<p class='c007'>As often as not, these bands are assisted by the Turkish inhabitants of
neighbouring villages. A large number of villages have thus been looted or burnt
and their decimated population has been obliged to flee.</p>

<p class='c007'>There should more particularly be mentioned the names of Yeni-Keui, south of
Shileh; about a dozen villages in the region north and north-east of Ada-Bazar, and
some twelve villages in the region south of Ada-Bazar, amongst them the large
village of Orta-Keui, near Gueiveh (16,000 inhabitants), and several villages south
and south-east of Ismid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since July 1920 the Greek military occupation had restricted the operations
of Turkish bands to the eastern and south-eastern part of the peninsula, but the
region of Karamursal (south of the Gulf of Ismid) still constitutes an impervious
Nationalist centre, from which various bands attack Greek villages in the neighbourhood,
aided by the population of Turkish villages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Excesses committed by enemy bands are often given as a motive or as a pretext
for these expeditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latter became very numerous in the spring of 1921, and extended as far as
the southern environs of Ismid, bringing about the destruction of all the Christian
villages in this region with the exception of Bagchejik.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek authorities have submitted a list of thirty-two villages looted or
burnt, with more than 12,000 persons massacred, 2,500 missing, and the remainder
of the population (more than 15,000) living as refugees at Ismid.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of the numerous witnesses examined by it, the commission is of the
opinion that these facts should be accepted as fundamentally true, notwithstanding
a certain amount of exaggeration in the figures.</p>
